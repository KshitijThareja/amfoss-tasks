# Krypto Scraper

This was the most challenging task out of all. I have spent weeks on this task trying to figure it out. Today, which is the last day of submissions, I had been working on this task from morning, trying to put together all the missing bits and pieces. 
After working for more than 6 hours on this task today, I was finally able to complete it. I can't express how elated I'm right now.
I guess I have written too much... just can't help it. Guess hardwork pays off in the end.
