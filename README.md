# Introduction
Hello! Myself Kshitij Thareja. I'm from Karnal, Haryana. My interest towards this club first developed when I started searching about this college on the internet. I just randomly landed on an answer on Quora. That's where I got to know more about this club and its reputation. This club, for sure, will be instrumental in helping me achieve the level of expertise in coding and also to explore the world of open source, which again, is quite fascinating. After completing the tasks given to us, though not completely, I feel like I've never been so much comfortable with coding than I am now. These tasks helped me explore various new fields and implored me to work harder to get to the end of each task. I look forward to doing all this stuff, be it by myself, or by any fortunate chance, as a part of this club.

# My views about the tasks

Doing these tasks was not easy, especially for a beginner like me. But the thrill of completing a task kept me going all the way. These tasks were quite fun, engaging, and a bit difficult too. But it was a great learning experience altogether. I got to learn so many new concepts related to coding and FOSS. This has increased my interest towards coding and I'm determined to continue exploring it more in future.
