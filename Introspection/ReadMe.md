# Introspection


### Why must we choose you?

Well, I can't say I know a lot of stuff related to coding. But what I can say is that I'm eager to learn. My love for anything and everything that is related to coding will never subside. And I am sure that amFOSS would help me able to achieve the heights that I have always dreamt of achieving. So, as I said, I am a beginner(not exactly, but yeah) to all of this. Initially, I won't bring a lot of skills with myself if I am selected to the club, but I'd find my interests and work on them with full dedication. What I will bring with myself is the passion to learn more and more, and the readiness to work as the club and the projects demand.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?

While doing the amFOSS tasks, I have developed a knack for coding. I want to excel in it in every possible way. I have decided to work on my coding skills and learn new stuff by myself,and with the help of the club, if I am fortunate enough of being selected. I would also like to explore more ways through which I can be a little more active in the field of coding, such as participating in online coding forums and contests. Rest all depends on the future, let's see what it holds for me.

### How would you contribute back to the club?

I'd always be available for help anytime and in anyway the club asks from me. Contributing back has always been important for me, so I'd try my level best to be of any aid to the club. As the time progresses, I am sure I would be able to work with others in various projects going on in the club. I've always been very open to learning. So, if a project is assigned to me and I don't have the required skillset for that, I'd try to learn its basics quickly so that I can be of maximum help. I'd try my best to live upto the club's expectations and standards.

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

The selection process is quite rigorous, which is justfied for a club of its stature. The tasks, the interview, everything has been  planned in a careful way. The tasks themselves were a great source of knowledge, doesn't matter if someone is selected for the club or not, this knowledge will always stay with us. All in all, I'd say that it was structured in the best way possible.
