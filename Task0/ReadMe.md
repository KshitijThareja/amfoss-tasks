## **Install Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS Release)**
So... I wasn't so sure at first about installing Ubuntu. I didn't want to leave the comfortable interface of Windows 10, which I was habitual to. But after hearing about the advantages of Ubuntu over Windows, I decided to give it a try. I couldn't keep both of the OSes as it would have been a burden on my laptop(256 gb SSD, i5 5th gen). So, I decided to remove Windows completely. And I'm glad I did it! I love the feel of Ubuntu. It's good.
And yeah, I've made a blogpost on how I installed Ubuntu, which, I think, can help others too. You can access it by clicking [here](https://kshitijthareja.blogspot.com/2022/11/how-to-install-ubuntu-2204-lts-on-your.html)
